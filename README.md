The DriverPass project focused on developing a cloud-based system to enhance customer service and operational efficiency for DriverPass, a company committed to addressing the gaps in driver training. Led by Liam, the client, the system aimed to streamline the process for individuals to prepare for and pass their DMV tests. Key features included online classes, practice tests, a reservation system for driving lessons, and integration with DMV updates. The design incorporated a user-friendly web interface, role-based access for employees, and a secure, adaptable backend leveraging cloud infrastructure. These elements ensured the system was comprehensive, reliable, and accessible for users.

A significant strength in this project was my focus on aligning the system design with user needs. Features such as multi-factor authentication for security, a modular interface for adaptability, and a seamless reservation experience were integrated based on insights from the clientâ€™s feedback. If I were to revise any part of the project, I would refine the user interface to include direct feedback mechanisms. This would help capture user preferences and challenges in real-time, ensuring continuous improvement in usability. In future system designs, I would use strategies like user journey mapping and iterative prototyping to better analyze user behavior and refine the product, ensuring it meets both client goals and user expectations.
